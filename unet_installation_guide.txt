U-Net Lane Detection Installation Guide:

1. Open command prompt or your systems equivalent

2. Clone the U-Net git repository by inputting the following command

	git clone https://github.com/Poodleduff4/Lane-Detection.git

3. Move into the newly installed directory

	cd Lane-Detection-UNet

4. Install the required dependencies

	pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Download the .pth files and place them in the main directory for the repository (you can exeriment with the two models to see their performance)

5. Create a virtual environment to run the program

	python -m venv venv
	Widnows Command: venv\Scripts\activate

	Linux/Mac Command: source venv/bin/activate

6. Run the model with the following command (there is an example image provided in the script):

	python unet/unet_inference.py   # U-Net baseline
	#   or
	python transunet/transunet_inference.py   # Vision-Transformer version

7. There are some example images in the "images" directory to test different images or video add said files into the "images" directory
and open the "inference.py" script and change the following line to the match your new image title

	image_path = 'images\\1_ahAGKqE3LNw-Ze1BIU0a9Q.jpg'

8. Repeat step 6

9. `video_inference.py` already imports the correct `TransUNet` class; no renaming is required.
